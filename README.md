iOS App - Final Project by Soo Spitz, Alex Jiang, Michelle Choi

This app is a lighthearted yet realistic app that applies the college grading system to life. In a lighthearted, yet somewhat realistic, manner, the app is designed to calculate what kind of life its users are living based on various categories. Our idea for the app stemmed from our belief that there are many more aspects to college life beyond the realm of GPA, which until this point is the only numerical/letter grade students receive while in college. Even when applying to jobs or internships, we see that an applicant’s previous work experience, acquired skills, and personal projects/research have much more weight on a resume than undergraduate GPA. We also recognize that a high GPA does not necessarily mean a student is happy and healthy. In addition to these examples, there are a plethora of other factors like sleep, overall health, friendships, and relationships that can also determine a student’s well-being while in college. This is where It’s Not So Bad comes in. We will take into account all of these categories when the app calculates a user’s grade. Users will be able to determine two aspects of their grade: the actual point value of a category as well as the weight that category will have in respect to their total grade. As a result, the resulting grade will be calculated in a highly personalized way. For example, if a user thinks that 30% of their college life is dependent on GPA, 20% is reliant on getting enough sleep, 20% is reliant on finding an internship, and 30% is maintaining healthy friendships, then our grade calculator will reflect their weighting to produce a final grade. In addition, we have decided to give users 8 semesters and 4 summers to input information. This way, users can reflect on his/her total 4-year college experience including summers.
